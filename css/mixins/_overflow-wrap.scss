/**
 * Overflow-Wrap
 *
 * Wraps text, which is too long to fit in one line and would otherwise create a text which overflows it's content box.
 * `word-wrap` is the legacy property name, which is still required by some
 * browsers.
 * Because Autoprefixer is not creating `word-wrap` when it
 * encounters `overflow-wrap`, use this mixin when setting `overflow-wrap`.
 *
 * From MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow-wrap):
 * In contrast to `word-break`, `overflow-wrap` will only create a break if an entire word cannot be placed on its own line without overflowing.
